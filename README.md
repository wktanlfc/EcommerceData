# Coupon Purchase Prediction
 Past Project
A previous approach at a business case with another programming language, now using other more comfortable languages to approach this problem.

Previous commits include segregating data into 3 different clusters via kmeans, for better management of memory and sparsity of matrixes.

Item to Item Collaborative Filtering across different coupons, for each unique user.
Recommender Systems used with modified Cosine similarity distances of paired items.
- Experimented with regular cosine similarity distances
- Centered Cosine similarity distances

Future implementation : 
will include the use of SVD for dimensionality reduction of a highly sparse matrix: 100000 records, for a 10000x20000 matrix.
