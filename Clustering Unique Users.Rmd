## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(qdapTools)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(FactoMineR) # for PCA Part 1 
library(kableExtra) # for nice tables
# alternative plot with ggplot for correlation 
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape) # to generate input for the plot use melt function
#install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
library(sqldf)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Clustering, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("useruniquecomputation.csv")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
